        <h1>HTML INTRO</h1>

        <p>Interstate 196 (I-196) is an auxiliary interstate highway that runs for 80.6 miles (129.7 km) in the US state of Michigan. It is a state trunkline highway that links Benton Harbor, South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids. I-196 is known as the
            Gerald R. Ford Freeway in Kent, Ottawa, and Allegan counties, after the 38th president of the United States, who was raised in Grand Rapids and served Michigan in the House of Representatives. There are two business loops (BL I-196) and one
            business spur (BS I-196) that serve the South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids areas. The current I-196 is the second in the state to bear the number. The Benton Harborâ€“Grand Rapids freeway was designated I-96 in the 1950s while another interstate,
            between Muskegon and Grand Rapids, was numbered I-196. That I-196 was built in the late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s. Michigan officials requested a change in 1963, which switched the two numbers. (This article is part of a featured
            topic: Interstate 96.)

        <h1>HTML OVERVIEW</h1>

        <p style="color:aquamarine; font-size:18px;">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
            document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page.
            Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in
            a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer
            of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <canvas> element, in collaboration with javascript.</p>

    <h1>XHTML MOTIVATION</h1>

    <a name="motivation">In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]</a>
